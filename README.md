- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and transformed monthly macroeconomic indicators.
- **Exchange Rate Metric**: Log-differenced average exchange rate to represent INR depreciation.
- **Visualization**: Plots for initial univariate insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
  - Lag and asymmetry modeling
